              </span>
              : Bangladesh, officially the People's Republic of Bangladesh, is a
              country in South Asia. It shares land borders with India and
              Myanmar (Burma). Nepal, Bhutan, and China are close to near
              Bangladesh but do not share a border with it. The country's
              maritime territory in the Bay of Bengal is roughly equal to the
              size of its land area. Bangladesh is the world's eighth most
              populous country. Dhaka is its capital and largest city, followed
              by Chittagong which has the country's largest port. The
              politically dominant Bengali Muslims make the nation the world's
              third largest Muslim-majority country. Most of Bangladesh is
              covered by the Bengal Delta, the largest delta on Earth.
